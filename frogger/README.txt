Assignment 2: Frogger Part 1 -- COMPLETE

2/15/13:

Description:
  -- Renders all initial graphics, including water and road color, FROGGER
  title, grass, and purple safe zones.
  -- Creates a first set of global variables to be used in other functions and
  initializes them. Note -- for this project, I have only created the
  variables necessary to render these initial graphics. For the next part
  where we begin the animation part of this game, I will add the rest of the
  variables as needed.
  -- Attempts to split graphic rendering into multiple functions. Splits up
  functions that will need to be called multiple times throughout one round
  (example: writing scores, levels, frog position, etc). This will be done to a
  greater degree of detail once the true magnitude of the program is realized
  during the animation section. For now, however, most of these functions
  should be relatively reusable with few, if any, changes.

Collaboration:
  -- None, unless you count a lot of help from stackoverflow and w3schools.

Hours spent: This part took about 30 minutes of modularity/reusability
planning and about 3 hours to actually code (most of that time spent looking
up functions needed.
    Total time spent: 3.5 hours
