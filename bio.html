I grew up in a town in Maryland, about 30 minutes south of Washington DC. Despite technically being a suburb, my town was defined mostly by farms - notably tobacco farms. 

I applied to Tufts as a Music Major, but promptly switched to Computer Science Engineering before my freshman year began. I do a lot of music in my life - notably, I am a piano player.

Fun fact: I found out last April that instead of being irish and Hungarian, I am in fact Cuban and Puerto Rican. Why this change? Well, my father found out last April that he was adopted.
