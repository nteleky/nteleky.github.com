            For 2013-2014, the plan is to focus on making our program better. That doesn't just mean
            help our program win more ballots - directly. That also means improving the way we work
            with each other, working to make sure that new members feel like they're a part of TMT
            more quickly, improving communication, making sure every member's voice is heard, and
            ultimately, making sure that mock trial is <span>fun. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
            To make the program better, we have to focus on <span>practical solutions</span> to solve
            problems. Below, you'll can see each solution I'm proposing and would like to implement
            if elected co-president. <br><br>

              Right now, captains have no way of getting anonymous feedback about their performance as
              captains from their team. This makes it difficult to know if their captaining methods
              are working well for each individual, see if changes need to be made, or address other
              concerns.

            <ul id="sollist">
                <li>How: Set up an online form and have TMT members rank their captains on several
                important attributes, then make any comments or suggestions to them. Allow members to
                submit this form anonymously. </li>
                <li>The co-presidents are the only ones with direct access to the forms. After going
                over them, the co-presidents meet with each captain to talk about what their team had
                to say and how to improve.</li>
                <li>Have evaluations in the middle of a semester (allows for captains to get feedback and immediately improve),
                and at the end of a semester (allows co-presidents to find the most effective captains
                for the following semester). </li>
                <li>
                This way, all captains can get feedback on the best ways to lead their teams to make
                their teams more efficient, more effective, and ultimately, more fun.

                 <li>This has been tossed around as an idea for a while, but it's time we made it happen:
                 having a couple meetings with all the new members to talk about some mock basics:
                 <ul>
                     <li>Midlands Rules of Evidence - go deeper than the program-wide meeting</li>
                     <li>Cross Examination/Impeachment</li>
                     <li>Writing Good Directs</li>
                 </ul>
                 </li>
                 <li>Different members of the team will lead each extra meeting, so that new members
                 can be exposed to different styles and members more quickly.</li>
                 <li>We want to encourage individual styles, so these meetings won't go into stylistic
                 things -- just how things technically work.</li>
                 <li>This also allows new members to get to know eachother, integrating them in the
                 program faster.</li>
