            For 2013-2014, the plan is to focus on making our program better. That doesn't just mean
            help our program win more ballots - directly. That also means improving the way we work
            with each other, working to make sure that new members feel like they're a part of TMT
            more quickly, improving communication, making sure every member's voice is heard, and
            ultimately, making sure that mock trial is <span>fun. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
            To make the program better, we have to focus on <span>practical solutions</span> to solve
            problems. Below, you'll can see each solution I'm proposing and would like to implement
            if elected co-president. <br><br>

              Right now, <span>captains have no way of getting anonymous feedback about their performance as
                  captains from their team.</span> This makes it difficult to know if their captaining methods

            <ul id="sollist">
                <li>How: Set up an online form and have TMT members rank their captains on several
                important attributes, then make any comments or suggestions to them. Allow members to
                submit this form anonymously. </li>
                <li>The co-presidents are the only ones with direct access to the forms. After going
                over them, the co-presidents meet with each captain to talk about what their team had
                to say and how to improve.</li>
                <li>Have evaluations in the middle of a semester (allows for captains to get feedback and immediately improve),
                and at the end of a semester (allows co-presidents to find the most effective captains
                for the following semester). </li>
                <li>
                This way, all captains can get feedback on the best ways to lead their teams to make
                their teams more efficient, more effective, and ultimately, more fun.

              New members are often intimidated by their captains because they feel the

            <ul id="sollist">
                <li>Pair each new member with an upperclassman who is not their captain, not on their
                team, and not a co-president. (i.e. not someone in a power position that could intimidate
                new members.)</li>
                <li>This mentor (like the big-little system in Greek life) is another resource for
                a new member and exists as someone they can go to to:</li> <ul>
                    <li>Ask questions about anything (objections, cross questions, etc)</li>
                    <li>Get a second-opinion about mock stuff before or after a practice</li>

                    <li>In general, get help adjusting to college/life at Tufts </li>
                </ul>
                <li>This allows new members to feel more connected to the program on a more
                personal level and get to know other members of the program outside of their
                first invitational team.</li>

            <ul id="sollist">
                <li>Set up scrimmages for ALL invitational teams 2-3 weeks into the invitational season (preferably 1.5-2 weeks before tournament weekend). This way a team can: <ul>
