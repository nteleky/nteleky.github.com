            This last year has been historic for our program. We were the only
            team in the country to send four teams to regionals and get
            <span>#4bids</span>. For the first time in Tufts Mock Trial history,
            we managed to get <span>#2bids</span> to Nationals. We've seen <span>
            unprecendented success </span>.
            </p>
            <p class='load' id="sent3">
            But we can do <span>even better</span>.
            </p>
            <p class='load' id="sent4">
            Over the past couple years, I've been on 6 teams with 21 different
            mockers, seen or been in over 50 rounds. blah blah
            Blah blah my strength is in <span>problem solving</span>.

            I can tell as I write this that this is too long. <span> Maybe too much
                animation? </span>
