            <p class='load' id="sent2">
            This last year has been historic for our program. We were the only
            team in the country to send four teams to regionals and get
            <span>#4bids</span>. For the first time in Tufts Mock Trial history,
            we managed to get <span>#2bids</span> to Nationals. We've seen <span>
            unprecendented success </span>.
            </p>
            <p class='load' id="sent3">
            But we can do <span>better</span>.
            </p>
            <p class='load' id="sent4">
            The challenge we face this year is to keep getting better at mock
            trial, but at the same time make sure it's fun. As co-president,
            my vision would be to expand on the foundation that's been laid by
            solving the problems we face and improving member satisfaction to
            truly make TMT one of the best mock programs in the country. By 
            focusing on practical <span>problem solving</span> and <span>
            improving communication</span>, both inside and outside our 
            program, we can get there. Problem solving is one of my greatest
            strengths and I am committed to make your voice heard and make 
            our program better.
