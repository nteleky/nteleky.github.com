        <p>Throughout the year, the Co-President has several important jobs,
        and to carry them out, that person needs to have several attributes.</p>

         <h2> Experience </h2>
         <p>Some of the most important jobs of the president are to pick captains, teams, stack for the Spring, and maintain relationships with other programs. In order to do that well, a successful president needs to be able to:
         <ul>
             <li>Lead a team</li>
             <li>Analyze and find good case strategies</li>
             <li>Understand what differentiates good mock trial from bad mock trial</li>
             <li>Be able to coach attorneys and witnesses (to help others do that)</li>
             <li>See where each member of the program is in terms of abilities.</li>

         </ul>
         Over the last year, I've shown that I have those skills:
         <ul>
             
             <li>Co-captained a team in the Fall that got second place at 
             Boston College and at Penn State's Happy Valley Invitational.</li>
             <li>Co-Captained the C-team second semester, worked with each member
             of the team, and managed to go 6-2 at Manchester Regionals after
             just two weeks of practice.</li>
             <li>Went to the Boston regional to watch a couple rounds with Tufts B and C^2 teams
             to see how each team member I hadn't seen yet was doing this year
             and get an idea of what we as a program needed to improve on.
             <li>Joined the B-team and helped design the case strategy after corrections were published and worked to help improve each aspect of the team.</li>
             <li>Went to Nationals and saw different styles and forms of mock trial
             to see what other schools do well and how our program as a whole can
             improve.</li>
         </ul>
         </p>
     </div>
     <div class='qual'>
         <h2>Vision</h2>
         <p>My vision for our program is to truly become elite, but without sacrificing
         the most important part: having fun.
         </p>
         <h3>Why does fun matter? What about just 'winning'?</h3>
         <p>
            We didn't join Tufts Mock Trial because we wanted to win stuff - we've
            only recently become one of the best schools in our area. When we 
            decided to try-out, it was because of all the hundreds of options we
            were given at the Activities Fair, mock trial seemed like something that
            would be fulfilling and, ultimately, be fun. We pay 50k-60k to be here
            at this school per year and get the many opportunities this school provides.
            Why would you waste that money or that time to do something you don't
            truly enjoy doing?<br>
            </p>
            <p>
            But that's not all; enjoying mock trial will make you better at mock
            trial. In the second semester, I've heard at least 6 judges talk about
            how it was clear that one team was more relaxed, less stressed, and seemed
            to be enjoying themselves more. If you love doing mock trial and aren't
            constantly stressed, you'll come off in a round as more confident. It also
            helps your preparation: if you're enjoying mock trial, you will spend more
            time working on mock trial and get better at it. That benefits everyone
            (except for the team you're facing).
            </p>
        <h3>
            How are we gonna get there?
        </h3>
        <p>
            By not only talking about ideas we have, but also implementing common-sense,
            practical solutions to the problems facing our program. I have a detailed
            plan
            to get us to a point where every member of the program is improving
            and feels valued from the moment that member gets accepted - things like
            Captain Training, a Mentor Program, better-timed scrimmages, and more.
